# SmartCellar

This is writen with the simple goal of helping people organize their cellar fridges and etc
my goal right now is to make it so that you can add that information by taking the picture of the barcode
for this ill use an api

ill have a problem to make the right product appear so there might be a need to be able to create a new database entries
if the product is not there

By the end of this if everything goes right ill have a nice program
